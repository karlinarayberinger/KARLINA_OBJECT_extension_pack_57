The following is a plain-text transcript of a conversation between karbytes and ChatGPT-5.2 which took place between 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time on 16_FEBRUARY_2026 and 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time on 17_FEBRUARY_2026. The conversation pertains to the order of a ten-disk spindle of 25-gigabyte M_DISCs and the order of three stainless steel 32-ounce water bottles (from Amazon dot Com and while using an Amazon locker as the delivery address for those items).

karbytes:

Yesterday a package I ordered from Amazon dot Com was delivered one day later than it was originally scheduled to due to the fact that the Amazon locker at that particular location was apparently full. I thought that the Amazon locker spaces were reserved upon shipping the respective products.

ChatGPT:

Your assumption is understandable, but Amazon Locker compartments are not actually reserved in advance when an item ships. Instead, the locker space is assigned only when the package physically arrives at the locker location and there is an available compartment. Here’s how it works in practice:

---

How Amazon Locker allocation really works

1. No pre-reservation during shipping

When your order ships, Amazon labels it with the locker destination.

However, no specific compartment is reserved yet.

The locker system does not “hold” empty slots ahead of time.

2. Assignment happens upon delivery attempt

When the carrier arrives at the locker, the system checks for an available compartment of the appropriate size.

If a compartment is available, the package is placed inside and assigned to you.

If all compartments are full, the carrier cannot deliver the package there.

3. What happens when the locker is full

The driver may:

Retry delivery later the same day or next day, or

Temporarily hold the package at a nearby facility until space frees up.

This causes the “delayed delivery due to full locker” message you saw.

---

Why lockers can fill up unexpectedly

Several factors make locker capacity unpredictable:

People don’t pick up packages immediately (they have up to 3 days).

Locker sizes vary, and large packages require larger compartments.

High-traffic locations (grocery stores, convenience stores, transit hubs) fill quickly.

Delivery batching, where many packages arrive at once.

Even if Amazon estimates delivery accurately, locker occupancy at the exact delivery time can’t be guaranteed.

---

Why Amazon doesn’t reserve compartments in advance

There are practical reasons:

Locker sizes vary, and Amazon doesn’t always know exact package dimensions until packing.

Reservations would reduce efficiency and cause unused empty compartments.

Lockers are shared by many carriers and delivery routes dynamically.

So Amazon uses a real-time allocation model instead of advance reservation.

---

What this means for future deliveries

To reduce the chance of delay:

Choose lockers at less busy locations

Suburban convenience stores often have more availability than urban Whole Foods.

Choose Amazon Locker+ or Amazon Hub Counter

These are staffed and have more flexible storage.
Ship to your home or workplace when possible.

---

If you want, I can also explain the internal logistics flow (warehouse → route planning → locker delivery decision tree) in more technical detail—it’s actually a pretty interesting distributed systems problem.

karbytes:

What happens if the locker is full the next day, the day after that, the day after that, and the day after that?

ChatGPT:

If the Amazon Locker remains full for multiple consecutive delivery attempts, Amazon does not keep trying indefinitely. There is a defined fallback process designed to prevent packages from getting stuck in limbo.

Here’s the typical sequence:

---

Stage 1: Reattempts (usually 1–3 days)

The carrier will retry delivery to the same locker on subsequent delivery routes.

During this time, your tracking may show messages like:

“Locker is full”

“Delivery delayed”

“Carrier will try again”

This phase usually lasts 1 to 3 days, depending on route frequency and locker turnover.

---

Stage 2: Automatic rerouting or reassignment

If the locker continues to be full, Amazon will typically do one of the following:

Option A: Redirect to a nearby locker

You’ll receive a notification that your package was redirected.

You’ll get a new pickup code and location.

Option B: Redirect to an Amazon Hub Counter (staffed location)

For example: a convenience store counter, pharmacy, or Whole Foods service desk.

Option C: Return to local delivery station temporarily

Held there until reassignment is possible.

---

Stage 3: Return to Amazon (if delivery cannot be completed)

If no suitable locker or alternate delivery method can be assigned after repeated attempts (usually several days), Amazon may:

Mark the package as “Undeliverable”

Return it to the fulfillment center

Issue you a refund automatically

This is uncommon but does happen if locker congestion persists or the locker location is temporarily unavailable.

---

Important distinction: once your package is in a locker, space is reserved

Your earlier assumption becomes true only after successful delivery:

Once placed in a locker, that compartment is reserved exclusively for you.

Amazon gives you 3 days to pick it up.

If you don’t pick it up, it is removed and returned.

But before delivery, there is no reservation guarantee.

---

What Amazon prioritizes internally

Amazon’s system generally tries to avoid returns, so it prefers:

1. Deliver to original locker

2. Deliver to nearby locker

3. Deliver to staffed pickup point

4. Deliver to your address (sometimes offered)

5. Return and refund (last resort)

---

Real-world worst-case timeline example

Day 0: Out for delivery → locker full

Day 1: Retry → locker full

Day 2: Retry → locker full

Day 3: Redirected to different pickup location

Day 4: Delivered successfully

Return-to-sender usually doesn’t occur until about 3–7 days of failed delivery attempts.

If you'd like, I can also explain how Amazon predicts locker availability probabilistically and why their estimates are usually—but not always—accurate.
