The physical universe which I live in might actually be a digital computer simulation running on hardware which is "more concrete" than the physical universe which I live in.

From my perspective, the physical universe which I live in is the basis for all qualia which I have ever been aware of existing (whether as nounena or as phenomena from my computational vantage). 

The digital information which I can observe, modify, replicate, and generate appears to subsist inside of physical hardware not as abstractions but as particular configurations of electrons inside of electronic circuits.

The abstractions my mind generates are also presumably reducible down to essentially nothing more than configurations of electrons inside of biochemical (but ultimately "electronic" circuits).
