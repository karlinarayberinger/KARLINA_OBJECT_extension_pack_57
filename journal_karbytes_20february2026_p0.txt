To Whom It May Concern:

It has come to my attention (following 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time on 19_FEBRUARY_2026) that there are some updates I would like to make to KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_57 before finalizing it (despite the fact that I prematurely declared that micro-directory as being in its finalized state (at approximately 6:31AM Pacific Standard Time on 19_FEBRUARY_2026)).

The new expected finalization date for that micro-directory is 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time on 20_FEBRUARY_2026.

Expected updates include the addition of at least one more song MP4 file and annotating the macro-directory of karbytes such that each index number for each micro-directory listed in that macro-directory web page is color-coded as follows:

"Mint Green Highlight" (#22bf71) -> finalized micro-directory.

"Lavender Highlight" (#b36bff) -> expected to be updated in the future micro-directory.

Sincerely, 
karbytes
